## Move failed_login_attempts out the DB and use Redis to save it in memory. Its faster that way. 
## Add account data to the create_user_open endpoint
## Add an endpoint to delete users.

## Need to implement the admin token Dependency on the superUser endpoints!!
# Consult AI on how to pas the token into the verify_admin_token function

changed the env file to auth-server.env and added it to the yaml file
Added some new fields to the user and account tables to implement 2FA
Removed failed_login_attempts
Updated schemas, models, Alembic, 
Fixed the init_db_code
Began to code in the 2Fa framework.
Testing the CreateUser, update_me, getAllUsers, get user by id, update by id

ISSUES:
   There is still an isssue with the update. with update by id, the account is not saving as it used to do
   and with update_me. it doesnt always save the account info.

Need tocreate some templates for password recovery
Need to implement 2FA, endpoints, etc.
