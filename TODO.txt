Add new fields to the User table
Implement the logic for the fields
  - failed_attempts (coed to count and timer for the max inputs)
  - account_locked (Dependency? Or just check it at every endpoint?)
  - is_verified (May just leave this as is_active, but I still need to bubild the verify email code)
Work on the logger. Maybe add a logger that is dedicated to logins, and other inportant actions.
