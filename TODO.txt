Create some Admin endpoints to poke around on the system. They can update, delete, logout any user. should make an admin 
mesaging system to send messgaes to users. Or implement an Admin to user websocket chat. but this feature is hidden. Only I can 
initiate the chat, but the user and administartor can chat back and forth. WOuld be cool is someone broke in. I could message the fucker.
